                Did you know? His feast day is on Oct 12 because that's when he
                died; it's not just picked randomly, it's also so we can
                remember the day he died and celebrate him for all the great
                things he did.

                Both he and I learned to program websites (HTML, CSS, and
                JavaScript) and how to edit videos at the same age, and he was a
                great role model for me. He taught me to never give up on my
                dreams and to always strive for excellence and God.

                I would ask him how he got into this stuff? For me it was just
                that I started to like robots, then got into Python and HTML
                (HTML is the language this is being typed out in; it's the
                layout, not the styling, anyone even a random 10 year old could
                learn basic HTML) and now I do a bunch of tech stuff! I wanna
                know how he got into the same stuff as me, and how he got into
                video editing and programming.
